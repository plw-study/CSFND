### Paper in 2023 Information Processing and Management

Pytorch code for 2023 IPM paper: "Not all fake news is semantically similar: Contextual semantic representation learning for multimodal fake news detection"

### Overview

This directory contains code necessary to run the CSFND. CSFND is a multimodal fake news detection model. See our paper for details on the code.


### Dataset

The meta-data of the Weibo and Twitter datasets used in our experiments are available in their papers.

Besides, the meta-data can be downloaded from the following project:

https://github.com/plw-study/MRML

### Requirements

The python version is python-3.7.9. The detailed version of some packages is available in requirements.txt. You can install all the required packages using the following command:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the code

The run.py is the main file for running the code.
